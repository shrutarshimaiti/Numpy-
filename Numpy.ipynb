        " A-Purpose of NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library in Python used for scientific computing and data analysis. Its primary purpose is to provide support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It enhances Python’s capabilities in numerical computation and serves as a foundation for other data science libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.\n",

        "Advantages of NumPy:\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient Data Structures:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays (ndarrays) are more efficient than Python lists for storing and processing large amounts of data. The arrays use contiguous memory locations, enabling faster access and modification compared to traditional lists.\n",
        "Vectorized Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy allows for vectorized operations, which eliminate the need for explicit loops. This means operations like addition, multiplication, and other element-wise calculations can be done directly on the entire array, leading to concise and readable code.\n",
        "Performance Optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is implemented in C, which makes it significantly faster for numerical computations compared to regular Python code. It provides optimized routines for numerical operations, reducing execution time for large-scale computations.\n",
        "Broad Functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy offers a wide range of functions, including statistical, linear algebra, and random number generation capabilities. This makes it versatile for various scientific applications.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays are stored more compactly in memory, which is crucial when dealing with large datasets. This is because they require less overhead than Python lists and use fixed data types.\n",
        "Broadcasting and Vectorization:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without creating unnecessary copies of data. This makes array operations more intuitive and efficient.\n",
        "Integration with Other Libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy integrates seamlessly with other data science libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and SciPy for scientific computations. This interoperability makes it a central component of the Python scientific ecosystem.\n",
        "Overall, NumPy enhances Python's capabilities by offering a high-performance, easy-to-use framework for numerical and data-intensive computations."

        "out: Optional output array to store the result.\n",
        "keepdims: If set to True, the reduced axes are left in the result as dimensions with size one.\n",

        "\n",
        "np.average() has an additional returned parameter that, when set to True, returns the sum of weights along with the average. This feature is not available in np.mean().\n",
        "Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "For a basic average calculation, np.mean() is slightly more efficient since it doesn’t involve the overhead of handling weights.\n",
        "4. When to Use Each Function:\n",
        "Use np.mean() for standard average calculations when there is no need to assign different weights to the elements.\n",
        "Use np.average() when dealing with weighted data or if you need to calculate the sum of weights along with the average.\n",

        " A-1. Vectorization in NumPy\n",
        "Definition: Vectorization refers to the process of applying operations to entire arrays (vectors) simultaneously, rather than iterating through individual elements using loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mechanism: In NumPy, operations are performed at a low level using compiled C code. This allows NumPy to take advantage of CPU optimizations and perform operations in parallel, making computations much faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance: Vectorized operations eliminate the overhead of Python’s for-loops, reducing the number of interpreted operations.\n",
        "Readability: Vectorized code is more concise and easier to read because it abstracts away the looping logic.\n",
        "2. Broadcasting in NumPy\n",
        "Definition: Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes by automatically expanding their dimensions to match each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: It simplifies operations between arrays of different shapes without requiring explicit replication of data. This saves both memory and computational time.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "When performing operations between two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise, starting from the last dimension. Two dimensions are compatible if:\n",
        "They are equal, or\n",
        "One of them is 1 (allowing for expansion).\n",
        "If the shapes are not compatible, broadcasting is not possible, and NumPy raises a ValueError.\n",
        "How Vectorization and Broadcasting Contribute to Efficient Array Operations\n",
        "Elimination of Explicit Loops:\n",
        "\n",
        "Both vectorization and broadcasting eliminate the need for looping through array elements. Looping in Python is slow due to its interpreted nature, whereas vectorized operations in NumPy are executed at a lower level using optimized C code.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting avoids the need to create large temporary arrays by \"logically\" expanding the smaller array without actually replicating data in memory.\n",
        "This results in less memory consumption and faster execution times, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "Parallel Execution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Many vectorized operations in NumPy are executed in parallel, leveraging CPU optimizations and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, which improve speed and throughput.\n",
        "Concise and Readable Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorized and broadcasted operations are often represented by a single line of code, making it easier to understand and maintain compared to traditional looping constructs.\n",
        "Numerical Stability:\n",
        "\n",
